# SCORE BOARD - Google App Engine Python && ActionScript 3.0

# ABOUT:
Building a flash game and storing scores using HMAC-ish way. This should prevent your friends from cURLing those requests and sending a name and score of their choice.

This project contains two parts - the back end in python, and the front end, in ActionScript 3.0

* Google App Engine Files - Follow the Google App Engine guide to set up the Launcher.  https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction
